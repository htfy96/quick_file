:QF something my-folder my-sub-folder

if you have wtf/wtf-my-folder-blahblah/wtf-my-sub-folder-blahblahblah/this-is-something-lol.py

it will locate and open this-is-something-lol.py for editing in no time.

All you need to jump to a file is to type a fragment of the filename, and optionally specify fragment of the folder that it resides in. The plugin will jump to the closest match and start editing it.(the more fragment you give, the preciser the match will be)

a big productivity improver.

Enjoy.
